	  <h3>How to Play</h3>
	  Code Monster teaches kids and adults a little about Javascript programming!
	  <br><br>
	  It's easy to play. Follow the instructions and do what Code
	  Monster says.  If you get stuck, just skip to the next lesson.
	  You can always come back to it later!  
	  <br><br>Click on the Reset button if you really mess up your
	  code and want to start over on a lesson. Click on the Back button 
	  to go back to a previous lesson. You can jump to a specific lesson
	  or back to the beginning using the "Lesson Sections" link.
	  <br><br>
	  Code Monster saves what lesson you are on, so feel free to stop
	  at any time and come back later.  As long as you come back on the
	  same browser on the same machine, you'll get back to your lesson.
	  <br><br>
	  Have fun!

	  <h3>About</h3>
	  Code Monster from Crunchzilla is an interactive tutorial for kids
	  that focuses on action.  Code changes immediately yield
	  visible results.
	  <br><br>
	  Projects start with simple boxes and colors, rapidly progressing
	  into exciting experiments with simple animation and
	  fractals. Important programming concepts like variables, loops,
	  conditionals, expressions, and functions are introduced
	  by example.
	  <br><br> 
	  Code Monster is a gentle and fun introduction to
	  programming concepts.  It is a first step in learning to program. It is
	  not intended to teach all of computer science and programming.
	  <br><br>
	  Code Monster is based in Seattle, WA.  It is part of the
	  Crunchzilla suite of game and educational projects developed by
	  Geeky Ventures.

	  <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
	  <b>What is the c in things like <code>c.save()</code>?</b>
	  <br><br>
	  It's a little technical but, if you want to know the details, <code>c</code> is a variable Code Monster creates for you that contains the Canvas' 2D context.
	  The code that creates the variable <code>c</code>, which is hidden, looks like
	  <br><br>
	  <code>var c = document.getElementById('pane').getContext('2d');</code>
	  <br><br>
	  <b>How can I save my code and use it outside of Code Monster?</b>
	  <br><br>
	  Short answer: It's not super easy, but you can copy-and-paste your code and then load that code in
	  an HTML file (either loading a separate Javascript file or inlining the
	  Javascript in your HTML file).
	  <br><br>
	  Longer answer: A minimal HTML file that works would look like this:
	  <br><br>
	  <code>
		&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
		<br>
		&lt;canvas id=pane width=400 height=300&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
		<br>
		&lt;script&gt;
		<br>
		var c = document.getElementById(&#39;pane&#39;).getContext(&#39;2d&#39;);
		<br>
		<br>
		// PASTE YOUR CODE HERE
		<br>
		<br>
		&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code>
	  <br><br>
	  If you copy that into a file, then copy-and-paste your code into it, then
	  save the file with a filename ending in .html, you should be able to load the
	  file in any web browser.
	  <br><br>
	  <b>Is there any other code that is hidden from me?</b>
	  <br><br>
	  There is also a bit of hidden code to try to stop animations when you
	  change lessons and the code you write is instrumented to try to
	  prevent infinite loops. You shouldn't need those to run your code
	  outside of Code Monster.
	  <br><br>
	  <b>Why aren't you telling me more about the syntax and terminology of Javascript?</b>
	  <br><br>
	  There are already a lot of tutorials and textbooks out there that teach Javascript
	  programming by explaining what a variable is, what variable scope is, what the syntax
	  of an if statement looks like, how each of the operators work, and so on. If you want
	  that, there are many choices available, many of which are excellent supplements to
	  Code Monster.
	  <br><br>
	  What is hard to find is a tutorial that is fun, immersive, and gets you immediately 
	  building cool things. Code Monster skips a lot of the syntax and explanation you 
	  can get elsewhere (Google for it when you need it) and instead jumps straight into
	  the fun of what you can do if you learn to code.
	  <br><br>
	  <b>Why doesn't this work perfectly on an iPad (or other mobile device)?</b>
	  <br><br>
	  Code Monster will load on many mobile devices, might even be a bit playable
	  depending on your device, but it isn't designed for mobile. Why not?
	  <br><br>
	  Mostly because it is hard to type on mobile. Writing large amounts on a mobile
	  device is difficult, and it is even worse when what you are trying to write is code
	  and you need to keep looking at other parts of the code. Trying to write
	  large amounts of traditional code on a mobile device is not a good experience.
	  <br><br>
	  In part because of that, no one seems to have created a great app yet for learning to code on
	  mobile, but there are good apps out there that teach programming 
	  concepts (such as Hopscotch, Move the Turtle, and Cargo-bot).
	  <br><br>
	  <b>Can I use Code Monster offline (when not connected to the internet)?</b>
	  <br><br>
	  Sure!  Code Monster only uses the internet at the very
	  beginning, to load the website, and then never contacts the
	  internet again.
	  <br><br>
	  So, for example, you can load Code Monster on a
	  laptop, then go on an airplane or walk to a park where there is
	  no internet connection, open your laptop there, and use Code
	  Monster without the internet.  It even still saves your place so
	  you get back to the same lesson when you return!  You donâ€™t need
	  an internet connection except at the very beginning
	  when the website loads.

	  <h3>Privacy Policy</h3> 

	  Code Monster is extremely protective of privacy.  Code Monster
	  keeps almost no information about people who use the website.
	  <br><br>
	  Code Monster does not require registration.  It does not have
	  your e-mail address.  It does not know who you are.  When you
	  use Code Monster, you are essentially anonymous.
	  <br><br>
	  Code Monster does not use cookies.  If you leave the website and
	  come back, there is a feature that will get you back to the
	  lesson you were on.  That does not use cookies.  It is done
	  using HTML5 Local Storage, which stores data on your machine,
	  not remotely on the webservers.  Code Monster does not even know
	  what lesson you were on or how many lessons people using Code
	  Monster have completed, and it is a bit of a shame that we do
	  not, but that is how seriously we take privacy.
	  <br><br> 
	  Like nearly all websites, Code Monster has web server logs that
	  may contain the IP address used to access the web server.  That
	  is standard in nearly all webservers and not an attempt at data
	  collection.
	  <br><br>
	  In keeping with standard language in privacy policies,
	  personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to a
	  third party unless required by law and we may update this policy
	  from time to time at our sole discretion.

	  We are very protective of your privacy.  We like it that way.
